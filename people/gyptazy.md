# gyptazy runs FreeBSD!

My love affair with [FreeBSD] started back in 2008 at a data center. It was the
king of the castle there, running all the network routers and firewalls. That's
also where I met pf, the firewall software&mdash;easy to learn, user-friendly,
yet powerful enough to handle intricate setups. pf is one of those tools I still
hold dear.

Fast forward, I was tasked with building a backup solution for our data center
clients. FreeBSD was a no-brainer. ZFS, the file system it uses, is a dream come
true. Data corruption? Not a chance (backups are still important, but wouldn't
you rather avoid the hassle in the first place? Don't forget restore testing!).
Plus, ZFS compresses data like a champ and lets you create snapshots&mdash;perfect
for those "oops" moments.

That experience sealed the deal for me. I ditched Linux and went all-in with
FreeBSD on all my personal systems. For years, it was my go-to for low-resource
machines. Where other OSes wouldn't even boot, FreeBSD thrived. Efficient and
lean, it squeezed the most out of every last drop of power.

Even today, FreeBSD and OpenBSD are my mainstays. They feel like home&mdash;familiar
and comfortable, even after all these years. The ports and packages system keeps
everything up-to-date, so I have access to the latest applications without
sacrificing that classic BSD feel.

The icing on the cake? The BSD community boasts some of the best documentation
out there. No flame wars, just clear, concise information. It's a breath of
fresh air compared to some other OS communities. That welcoming environment
extends beyond the OS itself, making the whole BSD experience truly fantastic.

Nowadays, I feel home in the <a href="https://bsd.cafe">BSD.cafe</a> community
but I'm also sitting in several BSD related channels in Matrix. You may also
find me on social networks like <a
